# Five Obstructions
This is a template for creativity and [lateral thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking) which challenges yourself and others to approach things differently by imposing arbitrary constraints on work.

## How to
Take a previously completed project/idea/program/thing and try to make it again but with this time with 5 obstructions placed on the creative process. You can generate these obstructions yourself or even, get a someone else to, or with the `five-obstuctions` script in this repository.

Alternatively why not challenge a friend with five obstructions for their project.


## Additional context

This idea is comes from the film, [*The Five Obstructions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Obstructions)  by Lars von Trier and JÃ¸rgen Leth, just applied to programming instead of film making. Similar ideas can be seen in  Brian Eno and Peter Schmidts [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) or Edward de Bonos [provoking operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_(lateral_thinking)).
